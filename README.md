### Tips & Extras

Are you stuck on a particular exercise or using a particular tool, or do you just want to read up a bit further? Here are a collection of issues that learners have experienced to help get you unstuck, combined with some starting points for more advanced topics. If you're still having issues, other great avenues to explore are reaching out to other members of your cohort who are likely to have seen similar issues, or to the trainers. 

See [this contact page](./contact_us.md) for how best to reach the trainers.

This documentation is living - it will need to grow as we and you learn new things, or the course changes.
