description: How to reach out for extra support
---

Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions/concerns. You can reach us in a few ways:

1) Slack. This is the quickest way to get a response. Send a message to your cohort's channel if you think others may be interested, or send a message directly to the trainers.

2) Email. Use the team address (<DevOpsDelivery@corndel.com>) and one of the trainers will respond. 

3) Video call. If you are facing a complex issue, so that a question and answer over text would not be effective, use these links to book a 30 minute call with one of the trainers. We ask you to try not to book more than one call per week unless you are trying to catch up on the course material.
