# WebEx Training

WebEx training is one of the platforms that we use for hosting workshops & group calls. It has a number of quirks, so keep an eye out for any of the following.

I'm sharing my screen, but they just see blank colours (or my background)
</summary>

_Usually_ this happens to Mac users - if that's you then see [this article from WebEx](https://help.webex.com/en-US/article/WBX9000035624/Screen-Sharing-Option-is-Greyed-Out-in-Webex-Meetings-on-Mac) for a step-by-step guide to enabling the relevant permissions.

Nobody can hear each other
</summary>

This is usually because, for whatever reason, the audio-conference attached to the room you're in has been stopped. The presenter should be able to start that back up using: Audio tab -> Integrated Voice Conference -> Start. Others should then see pop-ups appear inviting them to join the audio.

If you're not the presenter, you can usually claim that role from the current presenter in order to help someone else to achieve this.

I've raised my hand - is anyone coming?

A trainer should have been notified and will check in on you when they have an opportunity, but at times WebEx does fail to notify us - if you've been waiting more than a few minutes (or even if you haven't!) then feel free to reach out via Slack/Teams or email as well. Note that the chat is also lost when switching between rooms, so Slack/Teams/emails might be a better place for persistent conversations.
