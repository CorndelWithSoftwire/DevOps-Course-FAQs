# Aptem

Aptem is a training platform that we'll be using to help deliver the apprenticeship. Like many systems it has its own quirks, so you may well have questions.

I can't see the knowledge checks?
</summary>

If you're trying to open the knowledge checks and just seeing a blank screen, then you can:
* Try switching to an alternative browser, and see if that helps.
* Try leaving your browser tab open for several minutes - for some learners the Knowledge Checks are particularly slow to load.
If you still can't see any progress after 5 minutes then please reach out to us and we'll try to help.

The dates for our modules seem incorrect?
</summary>

Unfortunately Aptem isn't very flexible once modules have been established, and tends to drift out of date, so don't worry if the module timings don't seem correct. If you're unsure of any timings, or think that those displayed in Aptem are causing problems then please get in touch with us.
