Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform, and is the primary public cloud we use on the course.

You will be sent credentials for accessing our Azure tenant when you reach the relevant stage of the course.

* If you've lost your username, password, or 2fa device - reach out to a trainer who will be able to provide or reset those details.

* Occasionally we've seen learners stuck stuck in a redirect loop where Azure keeps asking you to re-register your 2FA device, then sign in, then repeats. If this happens, there are a few avenues to explore:
  * Try another browser, or in-private/incognito browsing on your device
  * Try registering an alternative 2fa approach - e.g. if you used an authenticator app originally, try registering for 2fa texts
  * Try leaving it and coming back later, or restarting your machine
