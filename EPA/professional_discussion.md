## Summary
The Professional Discussion is a one-hour interview with an independent assessor who will ask pre-prepared open questions to test your understanding of the criteria below. It is designed to give you the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge that is difficult to cover or to demonstrate in your project.

An additional breakdown of the KSBs, criteria, and possible questions is available [in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V_reG7kPau9D9__qQlHHR9rkl-IxekjxkEgIGt_6tHE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Hints
* Remember that the assessor only knows what you tell them - so if there's something you want to tell them about, do!
* You are welcome to have written notes to help prompt you; if you find some questions tough, or have particular stories you want to remember, then write them down beforehand.
* The assessment may refer to terminology that isn't common in your workplace, so make sure you're aware of the terms in the [Course Glossary](../glossary.md) and don't be afraid to draw on similar experiences even if they're not exactly the same.
  * For example, if asked whether you've ever facilitated a post-mortem you might say no; but if you've been involved in a retrospective or a lessons-learned session where you've discussed an incident & planned out a resolution or future preventions then bring this up!

## Common Questions
Below are some general questions that the assessor will often ask to open the assessment, and start to understand you and your role.

* Tell me about your role
* Talk me through a list of projects that you've worked on over the last couple of years
* What are the main things that you have learned and applied from the apprenticeship?
* What are the risks of CI/CD pipelines?
