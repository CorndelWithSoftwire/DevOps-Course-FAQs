# Work-Based Project FAQs

Frequently asked questions from learners who have started EPA.

This compliments the "EPA Submission Pack" which you should have received when you started EPA. Please contact the trainers if you do not have this pack.

What are the EPA timelines?
</summary>

Before your project starts the timelines are somewhat flexible so if you have concerns do speak to a trainer but these typically look like:
* With assistance from the preparation materials and work in Module 15, you will put together a draft project plan & submit that via Aptem by the end of Module 15
* With feedback from the trainers we will refine that plan so that it is ready to submit by the end of Module 16, along with two forms signed by yourself, by us, and by your manager.
* Your paperwork is then submitted when ready and typically your project will start three weeks later
  * BCS will confirm once you're ready to start, but often don't do so until the day the project is scheduled, so don't worry if you haven't heard in advance

The EPA window itself then covers a period of 16 weeks. This starts with a core 12 weeks for you to implement the project:
* Approximately 4 weeks into your project, BCS should schedule your Professional Discussion
  * At this point we'll also offer to coordinate a 1-1 preparation session
  * The assessment itself then typically takes place around the 6th week of your project
  * If you pass this discussion, BCS will _not_ give us any confirmation, you'll only receive feedback and a grade after completing the full Practical Assessment. If you were to fail this assessment, BCS would let us know so that we can organise a re-sit, so consider no news is good news at this stage!
* Approximately 8 weeks into your project we'll organise a review with you to see how things are going and provide any advice for where you might want to focus effort

You then have one additional week for you to gather & submit your evidence & presentation. Once that has been submitted, BCS will look to book in your Practical Assessment slot. The assessment itself typically takes place in week 15 or 16 to allow the assessor at least a week to familiarise themselves with your evidence.

After you've taken the Practical Assessment, BCS will usually provide feedback including your grade after approximately a week, so we'll be in touch to let you know how it went!

Is there anything else I should do while I'm working on the project?
</summary>

It is worth keeping some notes as you go to make it easier for you to fill in the Declaration Form and put together your evidence and presentation.
In particular, keep notes of:

* What you’ve worked on
* Roughly how long you’ve spent on-project each week
* How you have demonstrated each KSB + assessment criteria, and which ones you still need to demonstrate
  * You could do this by ticking off the KSBs on your project plan, or filling in the declaration form as you go

Your Professional Discussion interview will be scheduled for approximately half way through your project, BCS will send the invitation directly.

What happens if my project changes during EPA?
</summary>

Your work based project must have real business value, so it will also be affected by changes to business requirements during the project.
**As long as you can still demonstrate all the KSBs and criteria**, changes to your project are nothing to worry about and will not affect your grade.
When you fill in the declaration form at the end you will submit an updated KSB mapping where you can detail any differences from your original project plan.

If you're not sure whether you will still be able to fulfil all the KSBs/criteria, or you are now planning to demonstrate the KSBs/criteria in a significantly different way, then please get in contact with the trainers.
We can assist you in finding alternative paths to demonstrating the KSBs/criteria.

Can I submit early?
</summary>

It is generally fine to submit a few weeks before your submission deadline, though please let the trainers or your Skills Coach know ahead of time.

If you need to have your Practical Assessment early, because, for example, you'll be on leave, please contact a trainer urgently, as this needs arranging with BCS and may not always be possible.

What if I need more time to finish my project?
</summary>

It is worth noting that the business project doesn't have to be finished by your EPA deadline, you just need to have demonstrated the required criteria.

It may be possible to extend the EPA window in exceptional circumstances.
Please contact the trainers or your Skills Coach to discuss requesting an extension.

## Other questions and help during EPA

If you have any other questions please contact us through the usual channels:

* [Email the trainers](mailto:DevOpsDelivery@corndel.com) or your Skills Coach
* Contact the trainers on Slack
* Book a support call with any of the trainers (using the support-call-links channel on Slack), or email us with your availability if you would like a longer call

We cannot offer technical assistance with your EPA project itself.
You can receive help from your colleagues as you normally would at work, including from other learners at your employer.

We can still answer questions about the EPA in general, and discuss how to demonstrate particular criteria.
