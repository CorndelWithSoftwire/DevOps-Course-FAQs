# Work-Based Project FAQs

Frequently asked questions from learners who have started EPA.

This compliments the "EPA Submission Pack" which you should have received when you started EPA. Please contact the trainers if you do not have this pack.

Is there anything else I should do while I'm working on the project?
</summary>

It is worth keeping some notes as you go to make it easier for you to fill in the Declaration Form and put together your evidence and presentation.
In particular, keep notes of:

* What you’ve worked on
* Roughly how long you’ve spent on-project each week
* How you have demonstrated each KSB + assessment criteria, and which ones you still need to demonstrate

Your Professional Discussion interview will be scheduled for approximately half way through your project, BCS will send the invitation directly.

What happens if my project changes during EPA?
</summary>

Your work based project must have real business value, so it will also be affected by changes to business requirements during the project.
**As long as you can still demonstrate all the KSBs and criteria**, changes to your project are nothing to worry about and will not affect your grade.
When you fill in the declaration form at the end you will submit an updated KSB mapping where you can detail any differences from your original project plan.

If you're not sure whether you will still be able to fulfil all the KSBs/criteria, or you are now planning to demonstrate the KSBs/criteria in a significantly different way, then please get in contact with the trainers.
We can assist you in finding alternative paths to demonstrating the KSBs/criteria, and submit an updated KSB mapping for BCS to review if appropriate.

Can I submit early?
</summary>

It is generally fine to submit a few weeks before your submission deadline, though please let the trainers or your Skills Coach know ahead of time.

If you need to have your Practical Assessment early, because, for example, you'll be on leave, please contact a trainer urgently, as this needs arranging with BCS and may not always be possible.

What if I need more time to finish my project?
</summary>

It is worth noting that the business project doesn't have to be finished by your EPA deadline, you just need to have demonstrated the required criteria.

It may be possible to extend the EPA window in exceptional circumstances.
Please contact the trainers or your Skills Coach to discuss requesting an extension.

## Other questions and help during EPA

If you have any other questions please contact us through the usual channels:

* [Email the trainers](mailto:DevOpsDelivery@corndel.com) or your Skills Coach
* Contact the trainers on Slack
* Book a support call with any of the trainers (using the support-call-links channel on Slack), or email us with your availability if you would like a longer call

We cannot offer technical assistance with your EPA project itself.
You can receive help from your colleagues as you normally would at work, including from other learners at your employer.

We can still answer questions about the EPA in general, and discuss how to demonstrate particular criteria.
